Support Vector Machines (SVM)
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset was preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns (id, Unnamed: 32), handling missing values, encoding the target variable (M=1, B=0), and standardizing features for optimal SVM performance. Models were trained using both linear and RBF kernels, and performance was compared. For visualization, the dataset was reduced to 2D using PCA, and decision boundaries were plotted. Hyperparameters C and gamma were tuned via GridSearchCV, and the best model was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robustness. This project demonstrates SVM model training, kernel selection, dimensionality reduction for visualization, hyperparameter tuning, and model validation.
